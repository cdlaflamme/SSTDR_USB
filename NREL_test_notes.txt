notes for later

on program launch (should be on start logging but I'm lazy):
open file a+. seek to beginning, read first char. if nothing, empty:
write header row, set session/log number to 0.
if not empty:
seek to end, read last line (how?), set session to prev session+1, number=0

on log: start logging
on stop log: increment log number
